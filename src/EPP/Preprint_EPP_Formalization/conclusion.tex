This paper has presented a first-principles mathematical formalization of the Effect Propagation Process (EPP), a philosophical framework designed to advance the concept of causality beyond its classical, spacetime-bound limitations. The formalism provides precise set-theoretic definitions for the core EPP entities—Contextoids, Context Hypergraphs, Causaloids, and CausaloidGraphs—and outlines the operational dynamics of effect propagation, the generative functions enabling structural evolution, and the mechanisms of the Causal State Machine.

The development of this formalism was motivated by the increasing inadequacy of conventional causal models when faced with the intricate realities of advanced system engineering: specifically, the challenges of non-Euclidean data representation, non-linear temporal structures with complex feedback, and the emergence of causal relationships themselves within dynamic systems. By fundamentally detaching causality from a presupposed spacetime and a fixed temporal order, and by introducing the Causaloid as a unified, operational unit of effect transfer, the EPP formalism offers a robust and more general language for describing causal phenomena. Its capacity to explicitly model context as a dynamic, potentially non-Euclidean fabric, and to accommodate the notion of a generative function from which both context and causal structures can emerge, represents a significant departure from existing approaches.

This work lays a rigorous foundation for the continued theoretical development of EPP and underpins its computational instantiation in systems like DeepCausality\footnote{\url{https://deepcausality.com}}. While this paper focuses on the foundational definitions, future efforts will build upon this to explore specific algorithms, derive formal properties, and demonstrate empirical utility across diverse complex systems. Ultimately, the EPP formalism is offered as a coherent and extensible framework for advancing our ability to model, understand, and reason about the deeply interconnected and dynamically evolving causal fabric of the world.
