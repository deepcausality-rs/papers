\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

The study of cause and effect has served humankind for millennia and provides a foundation for scientific inquiry and intervention. 
Contemporary frameworks for computational causality, particularly those based on Directed Acyclic Graphs, offer powerful tools for reasoning within this domain. These classical models, however, are predicated on a set of core assumptions, including a fixed background spacetime, linear temporal progression, and static causal structures.  However, these assumptions become a limitation when addressing a class of complex, dynamic systems where the causal relationships themselves are subject to change.
