\begin{abstract}
The Effect Propagation Process (EPP) provides a spacetime-agnostic framework for computational causality, distinct from classical causality in its explicit handling of effect transmission. The EPP can operate in static, dynamic, or emergent modalities with profound epistemological implications.


The epistemology of the EPP begins with positivist foundations in static configurations where truth aligns with a predefined model. In a dynamic EPP, epistemology requires an interpretive stance where truth emphasizes coherent adaptability amidst non-linear temporal evolution. Lastly, its epistemology evolves further into a pragmatic understanding in co-emergent systems where the truth of relativistic, emergent causal relationships is validated by their functional efficacy.


The EPP framework serves as a philosophical foundation for advanced causal reasoning and enables relativistic, emergent causal relationships across complex non-linear time representations. Its epistemology enables novel explorations of understanding evolving causal knowledge in emergent systems and highlights the necessity for further research into their empirical validation.
